  <h3>Scatterplot</h3>
  <p>Questions that can be answered:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>When has the court predominantly lean liberal or conservative?</li>
    <li>When has the court taken on the most cases?</li>
    <li>Does the above differ by issue area? </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Sketch</p>
  <img src="img/scatterplot.png" alt="scatterplot sketch" height="400" width="600">
  <p>Implemented Interactions</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Toggle between total number of cases in a year vs. percent of cases in a year</li>
    <li>Change the issue area</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Concrete example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The user will view the graph, and then toggle between the two views if they feel so inclined</li>
    <li>The user can select either the court's entire history, or only view cases that were decided within a certain issue area</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Proposed impementation path:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Start with the scatterplot we already have</li>
    <li>Remove the grey "unspecified" dots from the graph</li>
    <li>Use the existing number aggregate data to create more data points for the percentage, not just number, of conservative/liberal cases</li>
    <li>Add the functionality to switch between the two views</li>
    <li>Implement switching issue areas</li>
  </ul>
