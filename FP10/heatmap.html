  <h3>Heatmap</h3>
  <p>Questions that can be answered:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Do justices vote differently depending on issue area?</li>
    <li>Do justices vote in the majority/minority more than others? </li>
    <li>Do justices vote in the majority/minority more based on certain issue areas? </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Implemented Interactions</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Switch between all different issue areas, or Civil Liberties vs. Non-Civil Liberties</li>
    <li>Show a breakdown of # conservative votes, # liberal votes, and percent of times in the majority or minority, in different ways: When hovering over a justices name, show this info for all of his decisions (across issue areas). When hovering over an individual box, show this info for that justice in that issue area. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Concrete example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The user will be presented with a heat map that shows how each justice voted in each issue area. </li>
    <li>If the user hovers over a justice name, a pie chart will show the breakdown of majority/minority votes over all issue areas for this justice</li>
    <li> The user can also hover over a specific box in the heat map to show the breakdown of majority/minority votes for this justice only in this issue area</li>
    <li> A button will also allow the user to cluster the issue areas into two different catagories, civil liberties and other (appearently useful).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Proposed impementation path:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Start with the heatmap we already have</li>
    <li>Group the data for button functionality (Civil liberties vs not) </li>
    <li>Implement button functionality (using the grouped data)</li>
    <li>Implement hover functionality/pie chart if possible with code we already have </li>
  </ul>
