<p>We can use the pie chart to answer questions about distribution. If each
slice is an issue area, it could show which issue areas the court hears cases
from. It could also show individual legal provisions, but I think that could
result in too many different slices for the pie chart. In terms of
interactivity, rather than looking at the court's history as a whole, a slider
could change the chief justice/era and look at how this has changed over time.
Using a donut chart rather than a pie chart could be visually helpful in our
case, as we could display information in the center such as the total number of
cases, or a portrait of the chief justice

A scatterplot a scatterplot could answer a number of questions, but
specifically, it could examine how liberal or conservative the court leans
throughout the years, by plotting the number of liberal decisions in each year
in one color, and the number of conservative decisions in another color, versus
time. Alternatively, rather than two different dots, there could be one dot that
reflects an average of the conservative and liberal decisions in a certain year on a
scale of -1 to 1, so years that are more liberal might be closer to 1 and years
that are more conservative might be closer to -1.
<br>
Alternatively, the scatterplot could show how individual justices have changed 
their voting preferences over time (though this might be better represented by
a line graph, explained later), and could be refined to look at only certain
issue areas whether for an individual justice or the court as a whole.

A bar chart could again answer many questions, but specifically, it could
examine which justices promote unity. The height of the would be the average
number of votes in the majority opinion, and the x axis would be each chief
justice. Again, this could be refined by issue area.
<br>
Alternatively, the bar chart could tackle the question of overruling precedent,
mapping in the frequency of precedent being overruled in given certain years or
chief justices. For this visualization to reveal interesting trends, clicking on
the bar could reveal information about which legal provisions were actually
overturned, or the issue areas they fall under.

<br><br>
Rather than relying on interactivity in the bar chart to show different issue
areas, the stacked bar chart could be split by issue area. Alternatively, it
could be split by conservative/liberal decision, to show whether a chief justice
was more concerned with unity in a certain direction than the other.

As mentioned earlier, a line graph could be used to show the voting preferences
of individual justices over time. Because the points are connected, it could be
more visually appealing in displaying this relationship. Additionally, it
could plot multiple justice's at once, with a different color, so they can be
compared individually - perhaps every justice under a certain chief justice, in
that ~10-30 year term.

<br><br>
A heat map could be another way to show the voting preferences of each chief
justice. With every justice on the Y axis, and every year on the x axis,  the
color of each box could represent how liberal or conservative they voted in that
year. Again, this could be refined by issue era, or by chief justice.

<br><br>
The choropleth could be used to examine any number of questions relating to
geography. Specifically, it could answer where cases are most likely to
originate from. At a county or state level, a color scale could reflect the
frequency of cases originating in a certain area.

<br><br>
Because there are so many individual legal provisions, a tree map could be used
to look at information in regards to these where a bar chart would be too busy.
It can show which legal provisions are most contentious overall, or in certain
years.
