<ul>
  <li> The data set we are working with has 65535 instances each with 61 attributes. </li>
  <li> Each data point represents one vote by a particular justice </li>
  <li> NOTE: we also have the ability to work with case-based data set rather than vote-based </li>
</ul>

<br> 

Here is a full list of the 61 attributes: <br> <br>

"caseId","docketId","caseIssuesId","voteId","dateDecision","decisionType","usCite","sctCite","ledCite","lexisCite","term", <br>
"naturalCourt","chief","docket","caseName","dateArgument","dateRearg","petitioner","petitionerState","respondent","respondentState", <br>
"jurisdiction","adminAction","adminActionState","threeJudgeFdc","caseOrigin","caseOriginState","caseSource","caseSourceState", <br>
"lcDisagreement","certReason","lcDisposition","lcDispositionDirection","declarationUncon","caseDisposition","caseDispositionUnusual", <br>
"partyWinning","precedentAlteration","voteUnclear","issue","issueArea","decisionDirection","decisionDirectionDissent", <br>
"authorityDecision1","authorityDecision2","lawType","lawSupp","lawMinor","majOpinWriter","majOpinAssigner","splitVote","majVotes", <br>
"minVotes","justice","justiceName","vote","opinion","direction","majority","firstAgreement","secondAgreement" <br> <br>

Here is an small example of what the data that is most useful to us would look like: <br> <br>

1965-133,6/20/1966,GEORGIA v. RACHEL et al.,9,JHarlan2 <br> <br>


<ul>
  <li> Case ID - a distinct identifier for each case [1946-001, 1978-158]</li>
  <li> Decision date -  MM/DD/YYYY - All cases since 1946 </li>
  <li> Case name - Will be the same most of the time for at least 9 lines consecutively (9 justice votes per case)</li>
  <li> issueArea - Numeric value representing a category for the issue [1,14] </li>

</ul>
