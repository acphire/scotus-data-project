Final Project Assignment 8 <br>
Supreme Court Data Project <br>

<div class=project-description>
      <div class="heading"> <h2>Detailed Data Information</h2></div>
      <div class="content">
        <p> We are using two versions of the SCDB: justice-centered and case-centered. The former has
        around 100,000 lines of data, 1 for each justice's vote in each case, and the latter around
        10,000 lines of data, 1 for each case. The justice-centered dataset includes all of the 
        information in the case-centered dataset, in addition to information about each justice's
        votes. </p>
        <p> Professor Sorenson has added the following useful columns to the Supreme Court databases </p>
        <p> In the justice-centered database:
          <ul>
            <li>term: The term (year) in which this case was decided. May consider using
                this rather than dateDecision for the year. This differs from the year in
                dateDecision in many cases, presumably because the court terms do not line
                up exactly with calendar years </li>


            <li>medianJJ:   The name of the median (or swing-vote) justice</li>
            <li>liberal:    1 if the justice is liberal, 0 if not)</li>
            <li>median:     1 if the justice is the median, 0 if not</li>
            <li>lib_median: 1 when the court is liberal and the justice is liberal (when
                              the justice is the swing vote)</li>
            <li>lib_court:  1 if the court is liberal, 0 if not</li>
          </ul>    
                NOTE: medianJJ and lib_court are all the same for a given term, while the
                      other variables differ for each case, for each justice.

                      <br> <br>

                In the case-centered database:
                <ul>
                  <li>term:       see above</li>
                  <li>medianJJ:   see above</li>
                  <li>lib_median: see above</li>
                  <li>lib_court:  see above</li>
                </ul>
          </p>
        </div>
</div>
