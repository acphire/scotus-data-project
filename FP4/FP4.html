  <p>The goal of our project is to create an interactive visualization of Supreme Court Justice's voting preferences, taking into account the era, as well as the area of the issue at hand. We are using a dataset that contains a variety of attributes from every individual justice's vote in every supreme court decision from 1946 to 2016. We hope to be able to discover how the court's decisions have changed over time, how individual justice's preferences have changed over time, and how they behave given different issue areas. In a variety of visuaziations, the user will be able to explore these relationships. For more information about our data, please refer to <a href=http://www.bowdoin.edu/~acphilli/proj/scotus-data-project/FP8/FP8.html">FP8</a>.</p>
