Pie Chart: http://www.bowdoin.edu/~acphilli/proj/scotus-data-project/FP6/piechart/piechart.html <br>
<ul>
  <li> The Pie chart shows the distribution of votes throughout 14 issue areas in a given year </li>
  <li> Definitely interesting to be able to look at different years</li>
  <li> Would it be possible to compare different years? </li>
  <li> Other possible interactive elements: a hover or click to show more information about a single issue area</li>
</ul>

<br> <br>

Scatterplot: http://www.bowdoin.edu/~acphilli/proj/scotus-data-project/FP6/scatterplot/scatterplot.html <br>
<ul>
  <li> The scatterplot shows the number of cases in each year, and which way these cases were decided: conservative, liberal, unspecifiable </li> 
  <li> The colors and axes need to be explained more in order for the user to have a better understanding </li>
  <li> The drop down menus are a good idea for analyzing specific parts of the data </li>
  <li> The Y axis could potentially be based on either the vote of a single justice or the actual decision of the court </li>
  <li> Rescaling the graph based on the years that a justice is active </li>
</ul>

<br> <br>

Heatmap: http://www.bowdoin.edu/~acphilli/proj/scotus-data-project/FP6/heatmap/heatmap.html <br>

<ul>
  <li> The heatmap shows how liberal or conservative a justice is based on issue area </li>
  <li> This visualization seemed to be a favorite. Seems intuitive and interesting </li>
  <li> Need to explain how the map is calculated </li>
  <li> Label the top with the actual issue areas rather than their data code </li>
  <li> Ability to choose an issue area and put all of the provisions of that issue area at the top </li>
  <li> Ability to change from looking at voting averages to how often each justice sides with the majority </li>
  <li> Possibly change the color scale to a divergent scale, so that conservative/liberal/moderate is easier to distinguish </li>
</ul>


Line graph: link <br>

<ul>
  <li> The line graph shows the average voting preference of each justice </li>
  <li> The votes casted by each justice in each year will be averaged together into a "voting preference" value </li>
  <li> This value will between 1 and 2, and will be represented on the y axis </li>
  <li> Would be really useful to be able to pan and zoom across the timeline of our data </li>
  <li> Seems to be a very helpful tool in analyzing and comparing justices </li>
</ul>
