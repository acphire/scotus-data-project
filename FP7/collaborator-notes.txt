FP7 Notes

Overall
- Really likes the scatterplot, line chart, and heatmap visualizations. Plans to use them in her Judicial Politics class
- Not as big a fan of the pie chart, but agrees that it is useful for a big-picture analysis
- When we brought up the idea of also looking at majority-minority data, she liked the idea and had some thoughts about it

Pie chart
- Thinks it's not incredibly interesting
- Would like to be able to filter by chief justice, to see how they change over time
  - expect that in the 60’s and 70’s, we will see more civil rights cases

Scatterplot
- Really likes how it shows when the court is conservative or liberal, and how it has leaned predominantly conservative in the modern era
- "unspecifiable" decision data is ignored in this field; remove those grey dots from the graph
- Add a button to toggle between percent vs. raw number
- Switch to case centered data set, because at the moment some cases are counted multiple times when there are multiple decisions associated with each case

Line chart
- Change the scale to 0=conservative, 1=liberal
- Really likes the ideas of being able to select individual justices to highlight, and to zoom in/out based on chief justice/year
- Have broad categories of justices that can be selected, in addition to individual ones
- Be able to look at swing justices - Sorenson will send us this data by Monday
    - When a justice is the swing vote, THEIR line for that period is highlighted or otherwise brought to attention
    - Be able to see if their voting behavior change when they became the swing vote

Heatmap
- In addition to individual issue areas, have a view with civil liberties cases lumped together (first 6 issue areas)
  - Could either have an "other" category, or use the decision direction classifications in the codebook for other aggregate categories
- Add a way to see the actual number of decisions and the mean associated with the color, maybe on hover

Majority-Minority ideas
- Could look at the percent that an individual justice is in the majority
    - Broken down by issue area
- If liberals are in the minority, it’s more interesting to look at the liberals and see when they’re voting WITH the conservatives
    - Party of the median is the de facto majority
    - Will use the swing vote dummy variable (as used in the line chart)
- Especially interested Unanimous vs. 5-4 cases
  - When looking at how often a justice is in the majority, break down by 9-0 vs. 5-4
  - Showing when their vote matters individually - swing vote
  - Did not have a specific suggestion on how to show this, but thinks we could find a way
