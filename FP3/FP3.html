The Supreme Court Data we are working with has 65535 instances with 61 attributes. <br>
Some of the attributes are numberic and some catagorical. <br> <br>

Here are some attributes that would be useful for our initial visualization ideas: <br> <br>


Pie Chart - Issue Area, Date, Total number of cases(for a certain timeframe)(could be calculated within code) <br>

Scatterplot - Decision Direction, Date <br>

Line Graph - Date, Justice Name, Decision Direction? (potentially for a layer of interactivity) <br>

Heat Map - Justice Name, Date <br> <br>

Some other potentially helpful attributes: caseId, caseName

<br><br>

Potentially a peice of our dataset could look like this: <br> <br>

caseId,dateDecision,caseName,issueArea,justiceName <br>
1946-001,11/18/1946,HALLIBURTON OIL WELL CEMENTING CO. v. WALKER et al., DOING BUSINESS AS DEPTHOGRAPH CO.,8,HHBurton <br>
1959-094,6/13/1960,PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD CO. v. UNITED STATES,9,HLBlack <br>
1965-133,6/20/1966,GEORGIA v. RACHEL et al.,9,JHarlan2 <br> <br>

Case ID - a distinct identifier for each case. <br>
Decision date -  MM/DD/YYYY <br>
Case name <br>
issueArea - Numeric value representing a category for the issue <br>
Name of justice voting in this instance <br> <br>
